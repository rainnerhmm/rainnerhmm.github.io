I was in over my head, but I had written notes within my code on what I was trying to do, I put it here to clean up the code.

Due to my code not working correctly at the beginning, it sparked an idea for the fishing line to act as a bungee cord...
...but it was more complicated then what I could achieve within my skills in a week.

I couldn't find anywhere to reference when trying to program what exactly I intended to do, the closest I can think of is, maybe, 'Cut the Rope'?
But there isn't exactly detailed guides to recreate it, especially when guides for other programming languages (usually game engines) tended to... 
...rely on in-built physics. (Atleast from what I could find).

The accidental physics that inspired it:
  // else if (fishLine.dist < fishLine.maxLength) {
  //   hook.x = fishLine.rodTipX -20;
  // }


  // if (fishLine.dist <= fishLine.maxLength){ // going down
  //   hook.velocity++;
  //   fishLine.maxLength = fishLine.maxLength + 0.1;
  //   hook.y = hook.y + hook.velocity;
  // }
  // else if (fishLine.dist >= fishLine.maxLength){ // going up
  //   hook.velocity--;
  //   fishLine.maxLength = fishLine.maxLength - 0.1;
  //   hook.y = hook.y + hook.velocity;
  // }

Notes about I wanted everything to interact and work:
// resistence/damper; makes the hook not a perpetual motion machine // velocity should be affected by resistance
// weight; the weight of the "hook" should play into it's resistence

// diameter/radius > weight > resistence > velocity

// if underwater > increase resistence > slows velocity

// if fish attaches > increases weight > increases resistence > slows velocity

// rod/fishing line logic

// maximum distance rod can extend // strain should have a threshold rather than a sole number, strain should be able...
// ...to extend farther than maximum before snapping

// if the fish pulls it cause the fishing line to fully extend, putting pressure on the line...
// two things could happen next!

// 1. small fish
// small fish will bounce back due to the strength of the fishing line, giving ample opportunity to reel it in...
// ...if the player reels in the fish before the fish begins to pull the hook, no pressure will be put on the fishing line

// 2. big fish and/or the "big one"
// big fish will bounce back momentarily (unless you begin reeling in first), but will put much more pressure on the fishing line...
// if the line snaps, you will lose money or score and get a new fishing rod.

// in theory if skilled enough you should be able to bungee almost any fish out of the water in one easy attempt.
